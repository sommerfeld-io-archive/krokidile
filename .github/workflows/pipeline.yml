# @file pipeline.yml
# @brief Deployment pipeline for the source2docs-website.
#
# @description The deployment pipeline for the source2docs-website is implemented using GitHub
# Actions. The primary objective of this pipeline is to assess the releasability of the application
# for deployment with every push to the ``main`` branch. This is achieved through a series of
# automated tests and validations (performed on all branches, but the ``main`` branch carries the
# code thatshould be stable and production-ready). The workflow is designed to build every artifact
# of the source2docs-website and subject it to various types of tests to verify its functionality
# and integrity. If all tests are successful, indicating that the project is ready for release, a
# release candidate is generated and published to DockerHub.
#
# The deployment process for the source2docs-website utilizes Docker images. Images are built and
# unit tested. Each Snapshot image is tagged with the commit-sha, providing a clear reference to
# the version of the codebase from which it was generated, and subsequently pushed to DockerHub.
# Following this initial deployment, the Snapshot Docker images undergo further testing (security,
# performance, acceptance, etc.) to assess their performance and stability. If these additional
# tests pass successfully (and the workflow is running on the ``main`` branch), indicating that the
# Snapshot image is robust and reliable, it is then tagged as a release candidate. Notably, release
# candidates are exclusively published from the ``main`` branch.
