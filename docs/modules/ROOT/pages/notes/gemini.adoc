== Building a Live Editor for PlantUML with Kroki Integration
This document explores building a live editor web application for PlantUML that utilizes Kroki.io for diagram rendering. It covers suggested toolstacks, proposes steps for development, and explores potential names for the project.

Here's a breakdown of the recommended tools for building this live editor:

== Frontend:
. React.js or Vue.js: Popular choices for interactive web applications, offering component-based structures and efficient updates.

== Backend:
. Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask: Suitable options for handling server-side communication and potentially acting as a proxy for Kroki requests.

== Live-editing:
. Monaco Editor or CodeMirror: Established libraries offering code editing functionalities with PlantUML syntax highlighting integration.

== Communication:
. WebSockets: Enable real-time, two-way communication between the editor and the backend for live diagram updates.

== Building the App
Here's a roadmap for building the live editor application:

. Frontend Setup:
.. Choose your preferred framework (React or Vue).
.. Set up the project structure with components for the editor and diagram display.
.. Integrate the chosen code editor component for PlantUML editing.

. Backend Setup:
.. Choose your preferred framework (Node or Python).
.. Develop an API endpoint to receive PlantUML code from the editor.
.. Implement logic to communicate with the Kroki server in a separate container.
.. Proxy the Kroki request with your PlantUML code and receive the generated diagram image.

. Live Editing:
.. Establish a WebSocket connection between the editor and the backend.
.. Send PlantUML code updates to the backend on every keystroke or code change.
.. Upon receiving updated code, the backend sends a request to Kroki and retrieves the updated diagram.
.. Update the diagram display component in the frontend with the newly generated image.

== Additional Considerations:
. Implement syntax highlighting and error checking for PlantUML code.
. Add features like zooming, panning, and exporting the diagram in different formats.
. Design a user-friendly interface for a smooth user experience.

== Docker Compose Setup
. Define separate services in your docker-compose.yml file:
.. One service for the Kroki server.
.. Another service for your editor application.
. Configure the editor service to expose the port used for the WebSocket connection.
. Define network settings to allow the editor service to access the Kroki server service.
